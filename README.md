For the execution of the code it is necessary to have cmake and the opencv and openMP libraries installed. I have used cmake to generate the program's make file automatically and check that the necessary dependencies are installed. Even so, to facilitate the execution, I have added a file called run. This small script when executed builds the project, compiles and executes it, so I recommend using it. The source code of the program is inside the build folder and is called DisplayImage.cpp .

When unzipped, the project also has a test image (mono.jpg) as well as an example of Sobel applied on it (mono_sobel.jpg). When running the program first asks for an absolute path with the image you want to convert by console and then asks for another absolute path to save the image resulting from applying Sobel. It will also display the image with the filter applied.
